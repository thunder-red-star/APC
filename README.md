# APC (soon™️)
*Disclaimer: I don't support pay-to-win, but I absolutely hate the people who dupe/lag/destroy servers because they're 
supposedly pay-to-win. You have no legal nor moral right to destroy someone's server just because they have a pay-to-win 
system, and a lot of the time you end up destroying servers that aren't even part of the problem. If you don't like it,
then don't play on it. Simple as that.*

Are you a server owner looking for *some* respite from randoms who claim to "support the Anti-P2W" movement, but in reality
are just looking to destroy your server (pay-to-win or not) for clout? Look no further! APC is a server-side plugin that allows you to block
known alts of annoying players like **zman1064** and **eTurbo**, or allow you to do basically anything to them in order to either
drive them away or make them regret their actions.

## Features
- Block known alts of annoying players (based on past videos, heuristics, IP tracking, and other sources)
- Apply any form of punishment to them, whether you want to ban them, mute them, prevent them from using specific commands,
  or just make their gameplay experience a living hell.
- Customizable settings to allow you to whitelist certain players if you want to.
- Lists of known alts are updated regularly, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with the latest alts.
- You can add your own blocklist to the plugin if you want to.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from Spigot (link coming soon) or compile the plugin yourself.
2. Place the plugin in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Start your server and configure the plugin to your liking. Make sure to reload the plugin if you've changed anything!
4. Enjoy a server free from the clutches of annoying randos!
